name: Options Test Suite
description: Test suite to verify command-line options handling. Uses bashi to test bashi.
# NOTE: These tests are using bashi to test bashi, which has a side-effect of capturing
# the output from bats rather than outputting to the terminal directly. Bats automatically
# switches to the tap formatter when its output is not a terminal, which affects the test by
# preventing the output from being tested as non-tap formatted. Therefore, all these tests
# assume --tap output formatting.
